Basically for model training i used 5 to 6 differnt ML algorithm like ensemble techniques Randomforest Regressor,Adaboost Regressor and Gradientboosting Regressor and from linear model i used Linear Regression and SVM also for training and after training i found that Random Forest Regressor gaved the best result and to improve the result we will use hyperparameter tuning or optimization techniques like Randomizedsearchcv and Gridsearchcv
